# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Players take turns clicking on buttons to make their moves, and the game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.

Features:
1) Graphical User Interface: The game features a graphical interface with a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2) Player Turns: Players take turns to make their moves. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O'.
3) Winning Condition: The game checks for a winning condition after each move and displays a message if a player wins.
4) Draw Condition: If the game board fills up without a winner, the game declares a draw.
5) Reset Option: Players can reset the game at any time using the "File" menu option.

How to Play:
1) Run the Python script.
2) Click on the buttons to place your 'X' or 'O' mark.
3) The game will automatically check for a winner or a draw.
4) Use the "File" menu to reset the game or exit.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language used for game logic.
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for creating the game's interface.
Git: Version control system for managing project files.
GitHub: Hosting platform for sharing the code and collaborating with others.
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the game according to your preferences. Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
